{"score": 0, "explanation": "Image is unrelated to the recipe"}

If the image shows food that could be the recipe, analyze how well it matches and score it between 25 and 100 points based on the following criteria:

Recipe Details:
Title: ${recipe.recipeTitle}
Ingredients: ${recipe.ingredients.join(", ")}
Directions: ${recipe.directions.join(" ")}

Scoring Criteria:
- Ingredient Visibility (25 points max): How many of the main ingredients are visible and recognizable?
- Preparation Accuracy (25 points max): Does the final presentation match the cooking instructions?
- Visual Appeal (25 points max): Quality of lighting, composition, and overall presentation
- Recipe Authenticity (25 points max): How authentic does this look compared to what the recipe describes?

Base score starts at 25 points for any food image that could plausibly be the recipe.
Provide a final score and a brief explanation.

Return ONLY a JSON object with two fields:
1. 'score': the numerical score (integer between 0 and 1000, use 0 ONLY for completely unrelated images)
2. 'explanation': brief explanation of the score

Example response formats:
For matching images:
{"score": 85, "explanation": "Strong presentation of key ingredients (20/25), follows recipe preparation (22/25), excellent lighting (23/25), authentic appearance (20/25). Total: 85/100"}

For unrelated images:
{"score": 0, "explanation": "Image is unrelated to the recipe"}`;
